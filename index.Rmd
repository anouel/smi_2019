# What are R Packages?

## R Packages {.build}

> 1.  Sets of Functions
> 2.  Set of Functions + Documentation
> 3.  Set of Functions + Documentation + Data 
> 4.  Set of Functions + Documentation + Data + Vignettes
> 5.  Set of Functions + Documentation + Data + Vignettes + Versions
> 6.  Set of Functions + Documentation + Data + Vignettes + Versions + Dependencies

## The resource with All the information

https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html

```{r, out.width="100%", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figure/writing_r_extensions.png")
```

## What's in a Name?

Package Names:

- must start with letter
- no underscores
- periods allowable or use CamelCase
- can have numbers
- should be Google-able

If you have a package name in mind before you start, use the `available` package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("available")
available::available("packageName")
```

Checks CRAN/Bioconductor/GitHub for potentially similar package names.

## Starting Up

- This will use [GitHub](https://github.com/) for packages, sign up for an account if you don't have one.

Use RStudio and the `devtools` and `usethis` packages.  It's easier.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("usethis")
```

In RStudio, File -> New Project -> New Directory -> R Package using devtools (scroll down).

## Trying our first build

In RStudio, click `Build → Clean and Rebuild`.

Boom! You have a package installed.

In RStudio, click `Build → Check Package`.  

This checks our package.


## Setting Up RStudio

Go to Build -> Configure Build Tools

Add `--as-cran` to "Check Package" (may not be necessary anymore)

## Setting Up: Documentation

In RStudio, click `Build → Configure Build Tools → Generate Documentation with Roxygen`. If that is gray, install `roxygen2`.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("roxygen2")
```

<img src="r_packages_figures/roxygen.png" style="width: 45%; display: block; margin: auto;">


## DESCRIPTION file

In the RStudio project, go to "Go to file/function" search bar on the menu bar. Also `Ctrl + .` on Mac.
    
- This searches through the files in the package.
  - Also searches for **function names** and can go to that function in the file

Type `DESCRIPTION` and open that file.

```{r, out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("r_packages_figures/DESCRIPTION.png")
```

```{r, out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("r_packages_figures/DESCRIPTION_overlay.png")
```


## DESCRIPTION 

- "Title - What the Package Does (Title Case)
- "Author: YOURNAME"
- "Maintainer: YOURNAME <your@email.com>"
- "Description: Use paragraph prose here.  Don't start with word package"
    Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
- "License: ", one of GPL-2 GPL-3 LGPL-2 LGPL-2.1 LGPL-3 AGPL-3 Artistic-2.0
BSD_2_clause BSD_3_clause MIT


## DESCRIPTION: additional fields

- **Imports:** package1, package2
  - packages with functions we need **in code**
- **Depends:** package3, package5
  - **ALL** functions loaded from package, but **loaded in user library** before your package
  - Similar to `library(package3); library(yourpackage)` - not recommended
- **Suggests:** package4, package6
  - used in **examples** or **vignettes**

## DESCRIPTION: not so fun default

In the RStudio build, it may add something like:

```
Depends: R (>= 3.5.3)
```

This is not great because anyone with a lower `R` version (like `3.4`) cannot install your package.  Unless you need the newest `R` functionality, delete this line.

# Additional Changes to DESCRIPTION

## Authors

I add this to the `DESCRIPTION` file:
```
Authors@R: person(given = "John",
           family = "Muschelli",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "muschellij2@gmail.com",
           comment = c(ORCID = "0000-0001-6469-1750"))
```

## Authors

I use `Authors@R` even if there is only one author because of the [`desc` package issue](https://github.com/r-lib/desc/issues/44) and that package is relied upon for site building and stuff later.

<div class="container"> 
<div id="left_col"> 
Roles, see `?person`

- `cre` - creator/maintainer, can only have one
- `aut` = author, can have multiple
</div>
<div id="right_col"> 
<img src="figure/highlander.gif" style="width:120%; margin: auto;" alt="flow"> 
<div>

## Maintainer

If you use `Authors@R`, you should be able to remove the Maintainer field, but 
I don't.  I am explicit about `Maintainer` because some people use that field as some parsers use `Author` and not `Authors@R`.

```
Maintainer: John Muschelli <muschellij2@gmail.com>
```

## License

I use `License: GPL-3` or `GPL-2`.

- For GPL-3:
```r
`r pkg_name`::use_gpl3_license()
```

https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/

https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/licenses.html

## DESCRIPTION: Package Title

Change the `Title` so that it's Title Case and make sure to put single quotes around weird words (like science-specific).  

```
Title: How to Analyze Data and Images
```

- do **not** start with R package or Package


## DESCRIPTION: Description

Change the `Description` so that it's a sentence (prose) and it ends with a period.  Also I keep putting single quotes around weird words (like science-specific).  Make sure to put links in angle brackets (`<http...>`).  Use DOIs if you can (`<doi...>`).  If you go too long on a line, indent it with 4 spaces "`    `" and go to the next.

- Look at some of favorite package descriptions


## Roxygen2

Roxygen allows for functions and documentation in the same file. Let's make a function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
top = function(x, n) {
  xx = x[1:n, 1:n]
  hist(xx)
  print(xx)
}
```

Save this to `top.R` file in `R/` (where R functions are).  Delete `hello.R` file if present.

## Adding a package to DESCRIPTION field

Say you want to use `dplyr` functions for your code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_package("dplyr")
```

but what if you did this instead?  (Function masking)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_package("dplyr", type = "Depends")
```

## Roxygen2

Highlight the following code:
```{r eval = FALSE}
top = function(x, n) {
```

Go to `Code -> Insert Roxygen Skeleton`

## Roxygen Skeleton

Roxygen header (what turns into a help file):

```
#' Title
#'
#' @param x 
#' @param n 
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
```

## Roxygen Skeleton

- `@param` stands for a parameter/argument for that function.  
- `@return` denotes what the function returns.  This is required.  
- `@export` - when people install your package, can they use this function
    - non-exported functions are usually helpers, really small, or not fully formed yet
    - `@examples` - code to show how the function works.  Wrap functions in `\dontrun{}` if not wanted to run and `\donttest{}` for not testing
      - make sure `\dontrun{}` not `\dontrun {}` (spaces fail)


## Roxygen Skeleton:

```
#' Print the top of a matrix
#' @param x a \code{matrix}
#' @param n Number of rows and columns to display of the matrix
#'
#' @return A \code{NULL}
#' @export
#'
#' @examples 
#' mat = matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10)
#' top(mat, n = 4)
#' \dontrun{
#'    top(mat, n = 10)
#' }
```

## Roxygen Skeleton

Instead of `Title`, you can use separate `@title` and `@description` tags if you want them to be different.  For example:

```
#' @title Print the top of a matrix
#' @description \code{top} is a small function to not just present the first rows
```

## Roxygen and Markdown

If you want to use `markdown` with `roxygen2`, then you can use 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
usethis::use_roxygen_md()
```

so instead of `\code{top}` you can write `` `top` `` from the previous slide.

## NAMESPACE


```{r, out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("r_packages_figures/NAMESPACE.png")
```

## NAMESPACE

```{r, out.width="100%", echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("r_packages_figures/NAMESPACE_overlay.png")
```

## NAMESPACE

In Roxygen:

- `@export` - adds this to the NAMESPACE file
   - when package is installed, users can call this function
- `@import` - in roxygen, if you want to import a **package**, you say `@import PACKAGENAME`
   - imports **ALL** functions from that package
   - if package is listed under Depends in DESCRIPTION, then the **whole package** is loaded when you load your package
   - otherwise it simply exposes them for your package to use them, but not the user, users still have to do `library(PACKAGENAME)`
   
# You do not have `library()` functions in R package code

## Check

Go to `Build → Check Package`.  You should see something like:

```
   top: no visible global function definition for ‘hist’
   Undefined global functions or variables:
     hist
   Consider adding
     importFrom("graphics", "hist")
   to your NAMESPACE file.
```

# The Goal is to have NO Errors/Warnings/Notes on R CMD Check

## NAMESPACE

- `@importFrom` - in roxygen, if you want to import a **function**, you say `@import PACKAGENAME func1 func2`
   - only imports these functions.  Better way of doing things.
   - if `pkgA` has function `A` and `pkgB` has functions `A` and `B`, if `@import pkgA A`,  `@import pkgB B`, then if you call `A()`, R knows it's from `pkgA`
   - you must import anything explicitly other than from the `base` package, includying anything from `stats` (e.g. `quantile`) or `graphics` (e.g. `hist`)

Add `@importFrom graphics hist` to your `top.R` file

## NAMESPACE

- You only have to import a whole package or a package function, don't mix and match
- You only have to import a function in **one** file.
- For example, `@importFrom graphics hist` can go in any `.R` file.

- Any package you want to import, make sure you use `use_package`, so we'd use:
```r
`r pkg_name`::use_package("graphics")
```
- Good practice is to import all packages, including base `R` packages (e.g. `graphics`, `stats`) when needed.  Don't import `base`.


## Build and Reload Again

- Go to `Build → Build and Reload`  the package
    - First time you may see some warnings (no NAMESPACE file!)
    - Rerunning may get rid of these
- Then try `Build → Check Package`

## Troubleshooting

In case things are not working or seem off 
 
- Delete the `NAMESPACE` file.  If building fails, add an empty file with `# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand` at the top and rerun.
- Delete the `man` folder 
   - `roxygen2` will create the documentation automatically


## Including Data

- Data should be small, but good for running examples or vignettes.

Run `use_data_raw()` if you have code to generate data (R data):

```{r}
usethis::use_data_raw()
```

## Including Data

Let's say you want to make a data set `mydata_set`:

At the end of the script, run
```{r}
usethis::use_data(mydata_set, compress = "xz")
```

And this will make a `data/mydata_set.rda` file.

## Including Non-R data

If you want to include other types of data (such as images) put them into the `inst/` folder (or a subfolder of `inst`).  You can access them using `system.file` when installed.

For example, if you have a file `inst/extdata/myimage.nii.gz`:

```{r}
system.file("extdata", "myimage.nii.gz", package = "PACKAGENAME")
```

will return the filename for you to access it in code, where `PACKAGENAME` is your package name.

## Unit Tests

Unit testing packages: `testthat` and `RUnit`.

To use `testthat`, run `usethis::use_testthat()`.  All test files must be in `testthat/tests/` and must start with the word `test`.

```r
testthat::test_that("Description of test", { 
# code for test
testthat::expect_equal(r, 3.5523334)
testthat::expect_true(x)
testthat::expect_is(my_df, "data.frame")
})
```

## Creating Vignettes

```r
`r pkg_name`::use_vignette("my-vignette")
```

`title` is on the document, `VignetteIndexEntry` is on the website:
```
---
title: "my-vignette"
output: rmarkdown::html_vignette
vignette: >
  %\VignetteIndexEntry{my-vignette}
  %\VignetteEngine{knitr::rmarkdown}
  %\VignetteEncoding{UTF-8}
---
```

## Creating a README

```r
`r pkg_name`::use_readme_rmd()
```

This will create a `README.Rmd` file for your GitHub/Package.

## Creating NEWS.md

```r
`r pkg_name`::use_news_md()
```

This will create a `NEWS.md` file to update with new versions of the package, discussing changes.


## Building CI and README

I run the short version of the code on http://johnmuschelli.com/neuroc/getting_ready_for_submission/index.html, which essentially to run (in R):
```r
`r pkg_name`::use_git()
`r pkg_name`::use_github() # must have GITHUB_PAT set up
`r pkg_name`::use_readme_rmd()
`r pkg_name`::use_appveyor()
`r pkg_name`::use_travis()
```

And edit the following files:

## `.travis.yml`

Add the following lines:
```
warnings_are_errors: true 
after_success:
  - Rscript -e 'covr::coveralls(type = "all")'
```
to `.travis.yml`.


## `appveyor.yml`

Add the following lines:
```
environment:
  global:
    WARNINGS_ARE_ERRORS: 1
```
to `appveyor.yml`.

## `README.md`
 
Add the following lines, changing `GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO` to the correct version
```
 [![Travis-CI Build Status] (https://travis-ci.org/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO.svg?branch=master)] (https://travis-ci.org/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO)
 [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO)
```
to the `README.md`. 


# Additional edits

I tend to add to the `README.md` an installation script (using `remotes` or `devtools`) :

````
## Installation

To install the package, please run:

```r
remotes::install_github("GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO")
```
````

I grab my `Description` field from `DESCRIPTION` file and add `The package DESCRIPTION_FIELD_HERE` in `README.md`
