# What are R Packages?

## R Packages {.build}

> 1.  Sets of Functions
> 2.  Set of Functions + Documentation
> 3.  Set of Functions + Documentation + Data 
> 4.  Set of Functions + Documentation + Data + Vignettes
> 5.  Set of Functions + Documentation + Data + Vignettes + Versions
> 6.  Set of Functions + Documentation + Data + Vignettes + Versions + Dependencies


## Starting Up

Use RStudio and the `devtools` package.  It's easier.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

In RStudio, File -> New Project -> New Directory -> R Package, with a name:

- must start with letter
- no underscores
- periods allowable or use CamelCase
- can have numbers


# Skeleton

I use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).  I do `File → New Project → New Directory → R Package` and I make sure "Create a git repository" is clicked.  I don't use `packrat` for my packages, so that is not clicked.

Things to do:

1.  Delete `R/hello.R`
2.  Delete `man/hello.Rd`
3.  In RStudio, `Build → Configure Build Tools → Generate Documentation with Roxygen`, make sure that's clicked.  I click `Vignettes` and `Build and Reload`. 
4.  In RStudio, add `--as-cran` under the "Check options" in `Build → Configure Build Tools`.
5.  Delete the `NAMESPACE` file.  If building fails, add an empty file with `# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand` at the top and rerun.


## Setting Up

Go to Build -> Configure Build Tools

Add `--as-cran` to "Check Package" (useful later)

## Setting Up

Click Generate documents with Roxygen.  If that is gray, install `roxygen2`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("roxygen2")
```

<img src="r_packages_figures/roxygen.png" style="width: 45%; display: block; margin: auto;">

Click "Configure" - click all the boxes.

## Configuring the Setup

- Delete the `man` folder 
   - `roxygen2` will create the documentation automatically
- Delete NAMESPACE file (we will discuss later)
- `roxygen2` will create the documentation automatically


## DESCRIPTION file

In the RStudio project, go to "Go to file/function" search bar on the menu bar.
    
- This searches through the files in the package.
  - Also searches for **function names** and can go to that function in the file

Type "DESCRIPTION" and open that file.

## DESCRIPTION file

- "Title - What the Package Does (Title Case)
- "Author: YOURNAME"
- "Maintainer: YOURNAME <your@email.com>"
- "Description: Use paragraph prose here.  Don't start with word package"
    Use four spaces when indenting paragraphs within the Description.
- "License: ", one of GPL-2 GPL-3 LGPL-2 LGPL-2.1 LGPL-3 AGPL-3 Artistic-2.0
BSD_2_clause BSD_3_clause MIT

## DESCRIPTION file: additional fields

- Imports: package1, package2
- packages with specific functions called in package
- Depends: package3, package5
  - packages with **ALL** functions loaded from package
- Suggests: package4, package6
  - used in **examples** or **vignettes**

## Roxygen2

Roxygen allows for functions and documentation in the same file. Let's make a function:

```{r eval = FALSE}
top = function(x, n) {
  xx = x[1:n, 1:n]
  hist(xx)
  print(xx)
}
```

Save this to `top.R` file in `R/` (where R functions are).  Delete `hello.R` file.

## Roxygen2

Highlight the following code:
```{r eval = FALSE}
top = function(x, n) {
```

Go to Code -> Insert Roxygen Skeleton

## Roxygen Skeleton:

Output:
```
#' Title
#'
#' @param x 
#' @param n 
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
```


## Roxygen Skeleton:

Add `@title` and `@description` tags:

```
#' @title
#' @description
#'
#' @param x 
#' @param n 
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
```


## Roxygen Skeleton:

> - `@param` stands for a parameter/argument for that function.  
> - `@return` denotes what the function returns.  This is required.  
> - `@export` - when people install your package, can they use this function
>   - non-exported functions are usually helpers, really small, or not fully formed yet
> - `@examples` - code to show how the function works.  Wrap functions in `\dontrun{}` if not wanted to run


## Roxygen Skeleton:

```
#' @title Print the top of a matrix
#' @description \code{top} is a small function to not just present the first rows
#' of a matrix, but also the first number of columns
#'
#' @param x a \code{matrix}
#' @param n Number of rows and columns to display of the matrix
#'
#' @return A \code{NULL}
#' @export
#'
#' @examples 
#' mat = matrix(rnorm(100), nrow = 10)
#' top(mat, n = 4)
#' \dontrun{
#'    top(mat, n = 10)
#' }
```


## NAMESPACE

The `NAMESPACE` files tells the R package what to import and export.  In Roxygen:

- `@export` - adds this to the NAMESPACE file
   - when package is installed, users can call this function
- `@import` - in roxygen, if you want to import a **package**, you say `@import PACKAGENAME`
   - imports **ALL** functions from that package
   - if package is listed under Depends in DESCRIPTION, then the **whole package** is loaded when you load your package
   - otherwise it simply exposes them for your package to use them, but not the user, users still have to do `library(PACKAGENAME)`

## NAMESPACE

- `@importFrom` - in roxygen, if you want to import a **function**, you say `@import PACKAGENAME func1 func2`
   - only imports these functions.  Better way of doing things.
   - if `pkgA` has function `A` and `pkgB` has functions `A` and `B`, if `@import pkgA A`,  `@import pkgB B`, then if you call `A()`, R knows it's from `pkgA`
   - you must import anything explicitly other than from the `base` package, includying anything from `stats` (e.g. `quantile`) or `graphics` (e.g. `hist`)

Add `@importFrom graphics hist` to your top.R file


## Build and Reload

- Go to Build -> Build and Reload the package
    - First time you may see some warnings (no NAMESPACE file!)
    - Rerunning should get rid of these
    - look in the folders
- Then try Build -> Check Package



```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
pkg_name = "usethis"
```


# Changes to DESCRIPTION

## Authors

I add this to the `DESCRIPTION` file:
```
Authors@R: person(given = "John",
           family = "Muschelli",
           role = "cre",
           email = "muschellij2@gmail.com")
```

I use `Authors@R` even if there is only one author because of the [`desc` package issue](https://github.com/r-lib/desc/issues/44) and that package is relied upon for site building and stuff later.

## Maintainer

```
Maintainer: John Muschelli <muschellij2@gmail.com>
```

I am explicit about `Maintainer` because some people use that field as some parsers use `Author` and not `Authors@R`.

## License

I use `License: GPL-2`. 

## Title

Change the `Title` so that it's Title Case and make sure to put single quotes around weird words (like science-specific).  


## Description

Change the `Description` so that it's a sentence and it ends with a period.  Also I keep putting single quotes around weird words (like science-specific).  Make sure to put links in angle brackets (`<http...>`).  Use DOIs if you can.  If you go too long on a line, indent it with 4 spaces "`    `".


# Building CI and README

I run the short version of the code on http://johnmuschelli.com/neuroc/getting_ready_for_submission/index.html, which essentially to run (in R):
```r
`r pkg_name`::use_git()
`r pkg_name`::use_github() # must have GITHUB_PAT set up
`r pkg_name`::use_readme_md()
`r pkg_name`::use_vignette("my-vignette")
`r pkg_name`::use_testthat()
`r pkg_name`::use_appveyor()
`r pkg_name`::use_travis()
```

And edit the following files:

## `.travis.yml`

Add the following lines:
```
warnings_are_errors: true 
after_success:
  - Rscript -e 'covr::coveralls(type = "all")'
```
to `.travis.yml`.


## `appveyor.yml`

Add the following lines:
```
environment:
  global:
    WARNINGS_ARE_ERRORS: 1
```
to `appveyor.yml`.

## `README.md`
 
Add the following lines, changing `GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO` to the correct version
```
 [![Travis-CI Build Status] (https://travis-ci.org/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO.svg?branch=master)] (https://travis-ci.org/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO)
 [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO)
```
to the `README.md`. 


# Additional edits

I tend to add to the `README.md` an installation script (using `remotes` or `devtools`) :

````
## Installation

To install the package, please run:

```r
remotes::install_github("GITHUB_USERNAME/REPO")
```
````

I grab my `Description` field from `DESCRIPTION` file and add `The package DESCRIPTION_FIELD_HERE` in `README.md`
